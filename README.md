## Malicious Code in Plugins

Plugins can contain malicious code! Before you install a plugin, make sure you are getting your plugins from a trusted source, or verify the code beforehand using your favourite .NET decompilation tool such as [ILSpy \(recommended\)](https://github.com/icsharpcode/ILSpy), [DNSpy](https://github.com/dnSpy/dnSpy), and the like.
